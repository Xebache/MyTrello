## Project

 `php` and `javascript` Web application inspired by Trello.

  This application was developed in an academic course during my second year of the bachelor in computed science at EPFC.  
  It uses a homemade framework provided by the teacher to simplify some steps (<a href="https://github.com/Xebache/MyTrello/tree/main/MyTrello!/framework">framework</a>).
